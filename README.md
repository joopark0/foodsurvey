# Food Survey App
Automated Food Survey completer created using React, Node.js, Express, Puppeteer, and Heroku

Most fast-food restaurants have a survey which you can fill out with your purchase that will return reward such as a free burger or drink with your next purchase. These surveys are generally long and a chore to complete. To give some reference, the Wendys Survey has around 30-35 questions to complete. This will skip the step and simple fill the survey it for you and return the code so you can get your reward!

## How it works

Enter your receipt info and it will send the info to the backend which will then return your code!

The receipt info that the user enters gets sent to the backend using REST. The web page then waits for the return code and loads it once complete
